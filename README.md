**Assignment 1: Gas fee and limit**
- Gas fee is calculated by multiplying the total units of computational effort (gas limit) by the price per unit (gas price).
- **Gas Used** is how much work the transactions needs
- **Gas Price/Gwei** is a smaller unit of ETH to make it readable. It is

- Think of Gas Used as Naira and Gwei as Kobo

> Gas Fee = Gas Units Used x Gas Price (Gwei)


**Assignment 2 Hashing Algorithms**
- **SHA256** and **KEC256** are different hashing algorithms that carry out the same thing
- SHA256 is used by Bitcoin and Keccak256 is used by Ethereum.
- **SHA256** and **KEC256** produce different hashes because they use diffrent constructions, padding rules and internal states, even though they output 256 bits both.
